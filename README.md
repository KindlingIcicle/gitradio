## About

GitRadio is a web application that allows you to subscribe to your Github repos and get _pleasing_ auditory notifications in realtime. 
It is designed to be able to blend in with your environment, and for you to be able to identify the events happening by a simple sound.

This means that you don't have to get those millions of emails and you don't have to stop listening to your music just to get auditory notifications.

Imagine knowing automatically that your upstream repo has been updated and being able to pull those changes in without having to leave your terminal.
